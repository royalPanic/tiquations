# Tiquations Documentation
Tiquations is an Open-Source Python package that is aimed at giving mathematicians and scientists easy access to important equations that they may use often. It was made in `Python 3.7` and should work on all versions higher than `3.0`.

# Installing
## Installing Tiquations using `pip`:
Open a terminal and enter `$ sudo pip install tiquations` and enter your password to install the module.

# Importing:
## Importing Module:
Need to import and use all of Tiquations? Use `import tiquations`. (It's recommended to import it as `tq`.)
## Importing Specific Methods:
If you wish to only use some of the methods from the module, simply use `from tiquations import {method to import}`.
